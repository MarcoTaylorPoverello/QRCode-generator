# QRCode-generator

- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a QR Code generator that you're able to download and save to your device.

# Features

- The application accepts `letters`, `numbers`, `email addresses`, `special characters` and `URLS` as criteria when generating your QR Code.
- The application features a `generate button` and a `download button`, so that once you've created your QR Code, you're able to download it and share it.
- The QR Codes are defaulted to save as `.png`.

# How does it generate QR codes?

- The application works with an `API` from `goqr.me/api` that has been integrated into this project.
- If you want to use the same method you can, as it is free to use and doesn't require you to have a profile.
